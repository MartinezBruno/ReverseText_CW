# ReverseText_CW
Reverse text app for CopyWrite Challenge

- You can use this app in 'https://cw-test-frontend.herokuapp.com/' <br>
It is pretty easy to use, just type something in the text input and press `Enter`

### But if you prefer running it in your local, do the next

### Back-End (api folder)

- First of all, locate yourself in the api folder and do\
 `npm install`
- Then run the API by doing `npm run dev`
- If you want to run the test do `npm test`

#### This API has only one endpoint: - `GET http://localhost:3001/reverseText?text="put your text here"`
 
 
### Front-End (client folder)

- First of all, locate yourself in the api folder and do\
 `npm install`
- Then run the API by doing `npm start` (Make sure you keep running the Back-End)
